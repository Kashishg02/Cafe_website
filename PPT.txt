>> Emerging technology is a term generally used to describe a new technology, 
   but it may also refer to the continuing development of an existing technology.

>> Emerging technologies include a variety of technologies such as educational 
   technology, information technology, nanotechnology, biotechnology, robotics, and
   artificial intelligence.

>> Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in 
   machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The
   term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a
   human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

One of future technology that I believe may come to pass is the invention of
flying cars.

AI in the sky â€“ 

Some researchers are looking to AI to develop a smarter car which can fly. 
Contactless delivery and on-demand access to any good, anywhere, has become the 
expectation rather than exception.
The soul purpose for this technology is to improve travel. 

Traveling greater distances will seem a common commute and will allow shorter 
travel time because of the high speed that will be attainable with this technology.
But with new technologies there are always risks that we have
to deal with. 
the skyway is an alternative solution to avoiding traffic jams and other problems
on the road.
